            You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However, I have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can save you real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services of two subsidiaries of Berkshire: GEICO and Borsheim's. <br><br>
            I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work in certain occupations more than GEICO does. I believe, however, that GEICO more frequently offers the low price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers. You can quickly find out whether you can save money by going to www.geico.com or by calling 800-555-2756. <br><br>
            Fine jewelry, watches and giftware will almost certainly cost you less at Borsheim's. I've looked at the figures for all publicly-owned jewelry companies and the contrast with Borsheim's is startling. Our one-store operation, with its huge volume, enables us to operate with costs that are fully 15-20 percentage points below those incurred by our competitors. We pass the benefits of this low-cost structure along to our customers. <br><br>
            Every year Borsheim's sends out thousands of selections to customers who want a long-distance opportunity to inspect what it offers and decide which, if any, item they'd like to purchase. We do a huge amount of business in this low-key way, which allows the shopper to conveniently see the exceptional values that we offer. Call Sean Moore or Karen Goracke at Borsheim's (800-642-4438) and save substantial money on your next purchase of jewelry.</p></div>

            Memo <br><br>
            From: Warren Buffett <br>
            Subject: Comparative Rights and Relative prices of Berkshire Class A and Class B Stock <br>
            Date: February 2, 1999 Updated July 3, 2003 and on January 20, 2010 <br><br>
            <b><u>Comparison of Class A and Class B Common Stock</u></b><br><br>
            Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has two classes of common stock designated Class A and Class B. A
            share of Class B common stock has the rights of 1/1,500th of a share of Class A common stock
            except that a Class B share has 1/10,000th of the voting rights of a Class A share (rather than
            1/1,500th of the vote). Each share of a Class A common stock is convertible at any time, at the
            holder’s option, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. This conversion privilege does not
            extend in the opposite direction. That is, holders of Class B shares are not able to convert them
            into Class A shares. Both Class A & B shareholders are entitled to attend the Berkshire
            Hathaway Annual Meeting which is held the first Saturday in May. <br><br>
            <b><u>The Relative Prices of Berkshire Class A and Class B Stock</u></b><br><br>
            The Class B can never sell for anything more than a tiny fraction above 1/1,500th of the price of
            A. When it rises above 1/1,500th, arbitrage takes place in which someone — perhaps the NYSE
            specialist — buys the A and converts it into B. This pushes the prices back into a 1:1,500 ratio. <br><br>
            On the other hand, the B can sell for less than 1/1,500th the price of the A since conversion
            doesn’t go in the reverse direction. All of this was spelled out in the prospectus that
            accompanied the issuance of the Class B. <br><br>
            When there is more demand for the B (relative to supply) than for the A, the B will sell at
            roughly 1/1,500th of the price of A. When there’s a lesser demand, it will fall to a discount.
            In my opinion, most of the time, the demand for the B will be such that it will trade at about
            1/1,500th of the price of the A. However, from time to time, a different supply-demand situation
            will prevail and the B will sell at some discount. In my opinion, again, when the B is at a
            discount of more than say, 1%, it offers a better buy than the A. When the two are at parity,
            however, anyone wishing to buy 1,500 or more B should consider buying A instead.</p>

        COMMON STOCK AND STOCK TRANSFER AGENT <br><br>
        EQ Shareowner Services (“EQ”), a division of Equiniti Trust Company., P. O. Box 64854, St. Paul, MN 55164-0854
        serves as Transfer Agent and Registrar for Berkshire’s common stock. <br><br>
        Berkshire has two classes of common stock designated Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Each share
        of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Shares of Class
        B common stock are not convertible into shares of Class A common stock. <br><br>
        Registered owner’s holding Berkshire stock in certificate form or through EQ’s direct registration system, may contact
        EQ directly for instructions regarding changes in registration, including shareowner’s mailing address or conversion of Class A
        shares to Class B shares. Correspondence may be directed to EQ at the address indicated above or at
        www.shareowneronline.com. Telephone inquiries should be directed to the Shareowner Relations Department at 1-877-602-
        7411 between 7:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. Central Time. Certificates for re-issue or transfer should be directed to the Transfer
        Department at the address indicated above. Shareowners can also view account information at the EQ website
        www.shareowneronline.com. <br><br>
        If a shareowner has lost or misplaced stock certificates, he or she should contact EQ to arrange for replacements. Transfer
        agent’s, including EQ, will require the shareowner to provide an indemnification bond based on the value of the share certificate
        being replaced. Shareholders are encouraged to contact EQ periodically to verify the mailing address of record to assure that
        Company communications are delivered. We encourage you to vote on shareholder proposals contained in our annual proxy
        solicitation. Contact with EQ is established automatically through the voting process. <br><br>
        Shareholders of record with EQ, who wish to convert Class A common stock into Class B common stock may contact
        EQ in writing. Along with the underlying stock certificate, shareholders should provide EQ with specific written instructions
        regarding the number of shares to be converted and the manner in which the Class B shares are to be registered. We recommend
        that you use certified or registered mail to EQ Shareowner Services, 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights,
        MN 55120 when delivering the stock certificates and written instructions. <br><br>
        Owners holding Berkshire common stock in street name (in a bank, broker or other nominee account) should contact the
        bank, broker or nominee for changes in registration. If Class A shares are held in “street name,” shareholders wishing to convert
        all or a portion of their holding to Class B should contact their broker or bank nominee. It will be necessary for the nominee to
        make the request for conversion.</p>
